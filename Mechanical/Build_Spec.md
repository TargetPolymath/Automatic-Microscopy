# Vision
### Version 01 - Bare Prototype

Manually capture images through the camera and move the stepper motor in the CD drive.

# Image Capture
The ordered Canon Camera to 23mm Microscope adapter arrived. It was inspected, installed, and tested. 
Images are available in the 'Current Products' folder until they are replaced, at which time they'll be moved to the 'Old Products' folder.

Image capture software - Engangle running on Ubuntu 18.04 - was tested and found functional for manual capture.

- [x] Mount Camera
- [x] Identify simple software approach
- [x] Attempt to take images

# Lateral Motion

A CD driver was identified for this test. After simple testing, I determined to affix it directly to the stage on the microscope and drive it from an Arduino.

- [x] Solder leads to CD driver
- [ ] Wire to Arduino
- [ ] Attempt basic Stepper motor operation w/ Arduino

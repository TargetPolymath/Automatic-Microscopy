# Vision:
## Hardware
- [x] I want to build a computer-controlled microscopy setup for imaging of large (Tens or hundreds of FOV) samples.  
- [x] I want the stage to move programatically, in sync with a digital image capture system.  
- [ ] I want to be able to take multiple sets of images rapidly so that I can watch a process unfold in time.  
- [ ] I want to be able to programatically change the focal height of the microscope.  

## Software
- [ ] I want analysis software which can stitch images together with imprecise positional data (EG partially relying on visual information).  
- [ ] I want analysis software which can use multiple overlapping images to perform sub-pixel sampling for higher effective resolution.  
- [ ] I want analysis software which can perform 'computed tomography' on images at different focus depths, to build up a 3D structure.  
- [ ] I want analysis software which can receive information about the FOV of the microscope is, along with the length of the sample, and produce a 'schedule' on its own.  

# Constraints
- [x] I want the mechanical and digital systems to be compatible with currently-owned microscope hardware (Optical SWIFT microscope, seemingly M950-series), which may be disassembled but must not be damaged.  
- [x] I want the digital image capture systems, to the extent they use currently-owned cameras, to not damage or risk damage to those cameras unless a replacement is easily purchasable.  
- [x] want the control to run on pre-existing computer hardware, specifically a Dell OptiPlex 780 (which is already on the same table as the microscope).  
- [ ] I want the analysis to run on this same OptiPlex 780, but running on other currently-owned computing hardware is acceptable.  
- [x] I want the mechanical control system to be primarily constructed out of pre-existing components; however, the digital image capture system will require new or extensively modified parts, which is acceptable.

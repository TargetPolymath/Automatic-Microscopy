# What is AutoMicro?

AutoMicro is the sub-project deliverable focused on programming the Arduino to respond to commands over Serial. It would have been structured as a 'Project' within GitHub, but AutoMicro took very little time to execute and was essentially linear.

# Why is this here?

You may notice this is not the main focus of the Automatic Microscopy project as a whole. This has been included to give an example of a data-gathering platform which can produce results that get fed into the Automatic Microscopy project at large.

# What hardware is this for?

I assembled this with an Arduino Mega 2560, a single stepper control board (ULN2003 with breakout), some wiring, and a CD driver scavenged from a CD player.

# Where can I find these instructions?

I've included general instructions in Instructions.md in this same folder.
